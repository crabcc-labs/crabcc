# crabcc

> **Symbol index for AI coding agents.** Returns compact JSON, not file dumps.
> **47–4400× faster than `grep -rn`** on monorepos. **5–100× faster than `ripgrep`** on whole-repo lookups.
> **85% fewer bytes** sent to the LLM in aggregate.

A small Rust CLI + MCP server that indexes your repo's symbols (functions, classes,
methods, etc.) into a SQLite store and exposes them via four primitives an agent
actually wants: `sym`, `refs`, `callers`, `outline`. Plus token-shaping flags
(`--count`, `--files-only`, `--limit`) that collapse 16k-token result sets to ~3
tokens when the question only needs a number or a deduped file list.

Languages today: TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Ruby. Adding a language is a tree-sitter
grammar plus an extractor.

---

## Why

`grep -rn` and `find . -name` are the wrong defaults for an LLM. They walk
`node_modules/`, `.git/`, `tmp/`. They emit unstructured text the agent has to
re-parse. They don't understand "symbol" — `class User` and the string `"User"` look
the same to grep. And on a real monorepo (~13k files), they routinely **time out at
60 seconds**.

`rg`/`fd` fix the gitignore part but still rescan from disk on every query. crabcc
reads from a SQLite index — the answer is already in memory. Plus the output is
typed: `{name, kind, signature, parent, file, line_start, line_end}`, not a wall of
text.

---

## Install

```bash
cargo install --path crates/crabcc-cli
crabcc index            # one-time, ~5–30s on a 13k-file repo
crabcc refresh          # incremental, ~250ms no-op (mtime + sha256 keyed)
```

The index lives at `.crabcc/index.db` per repo. Add `.crabcc/` to `.gitignore`.

### Claude Code integration

`crabcc` ships as an MCP server, a skill, and a slash command. To install all three globally:

```bash
# MCP — exposes 9 tools to Claude Code (sym/refs/callers/outline/files/index/refresh/fuzzy/prefix)
# Add to ~/.claude.json under "mcpServers":
#   "crabcc": { "command": "crabcc", "args": ["--mcp"] }

# Skill — auto-loads the routing rules
ln -s "$(pwd)/skill/crabcc/SKILL.md" ~/.claude/skills/crabcc/SKILL.md

# Command — /crabcc-init slash command
ln -s "$(pwd)/commands/crabcc-init.md" ~/.claude/commands/crabcc-init.md
```

Then `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code.

## Usage

| Question                             | Command                                              |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Where is `Foo` defined?              | `crabcc sym Foo`                                     |
| What calls `handleAuth`?             | `crabcc callers handleAuth`                          |
| **How many** call sites of `find_by`?| `crabcc callers find_by --count`                     |
| **Which files** reference `UserId`?  | `crabcc refs UserId --files-only --limit 20`         |

## Token-shaping flags

`refs` and `callers` accept three mutually-exclusive output shapes:

```bash
crabcc refs Assessment                       # 62,541 bytes — full hits
crabcc refs Assessment --files-only --limit 5    # 253 bytes  (–99.6%)
crabcc refs Assessment --count                   # 14 bytes   (–99.98%)
```

Pick the smallest shape the question allows. The early-stop on `--limit` makes the
small-shape calls cheaper at the CLI layer too — not just smaller payload, fewer
files walked.

Pair with `jq` for projection:

```bash
crabcc outline foo.rb | jq -r '.[] | [.name, .line_start] | @tsv'
crabcc callers find_by | jq 'group_by(.file) | map({file: .[0].file, n: length})'
```

## Bench results (mc-mothership, ~13k indexed files)

CLI-vs-CLI, no Claude session involved. Measures only the bytes the LLM's stdout
buffer would receive and wall-time.

| Task                    | crabcc B | grep B    | crabcc | grep   | speedup |
|-------------------------|---------:|----------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| `sym User`              | 1.2k     | TIMEOUT⚠   | 68ms   | 60s ⚠  | **884×**|
| `sym Assessment`        | 584      | TIMEOUT⚠   | 61ms   | 60s ⚠  | **982×**|
| `callers --count find_by`| 14       | 9         | 1.06s  | 48.9s  | 46×     |
| `refs --files-only Assessment` | 513 | 460     | 32ms   | 14.0s  | 436×    |
| `files --ext rb` (whole repo)  | 244k| 1.9M     | 14ms   | 10.4s  | 757×    |
| `callers --files-only find_by` | 821 | 831     | 56ms   | 47.0s  | **841×**|

Aggregate: **85% fewer bytes** (≈ 411k input tokens saved per batch), **182× faster
aggregate wall-time**.

Honest losses: single-file outline of a small file (where `grep -nE` is already
trivial) and small directory listings. crabcc returns rich JSON, raw `grep` returns
just the matching lines — when the question is small, raw wins on bytes.

## Architecture

```
crates/crabcc-core/   ← extraction, indexing, queries, FTS, tracking
crates/crabcc-cli/    ← clap CLI; Cmd dispatcher
crates/crabcc-mcp/    ← stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 MCP server
schema/001_init.sql   ← SQLite schema (files, symbols, edges)
skill/crabcc/         ← Claude Code skill (auto-routing rules)
commands/             ← Claude Code slash commands
bench/                ← raw-CLI A/B benchmark harness + visualize
```

- **Indexing**: ignore-walks the repo, runs tree-sitter per file, extracts symbols
  via per-language rules in `extract.rs`, persists to SQLite.
- **`sym`**: SQL lookup, `WHERE name = ?`. Microseconds.
- **`refs`**: enumerate indexed files, `memchr` prefilter on the byte needle, walk
  tree-sitter to find identifier nodes equal to the name. Early-stops on `--limit`.
- **`callers`**: same as refs but uses ast-grep patterns `name($$$)` and
  `$RECV.name($$$)` to also catch method-receiver calls.
- **`outline`**: SQL `WHERE file_id = ? ORDER BY line_start`.
- **`files`**: SQL on the indexed-files table, optionally filtered by prefix/lang/ext.
- **`fuzzy` / `prefix`**: Tantivy sidecar at `.crabcc/tantivy/`. Rebuilt automatically
  on `crabcc index`; explicit `crabcc fts-rebuild` for refresh-only flows.
- **`track`**: appends a JSONL log to `~/.crabcc/usage.log`, summarized by `crabcc track`.
- **`watch`**: notify-debouncer-mini-based FS watcher running on its own thread.
  Auto-runs `refresh` on file changes. Feedback-loop guard skips events under `.crabcc/`.
- **`graph`**: call-graph BFS sidecar persisted at `.crabcc/graph.json`. Build once with
  `crabcc graph-build`, query with `crabcc graph NAME [--dir callers|callees] [--depth N]`.

## When NOT to use crabcc

| Situation                                     | Reach for                              |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Free-text in markdown / yaml / json / configs | `rg "pattern" path/`                   |
| Need full function bodies                     | `crabcc sym X`, then `Read` line range |
| Filename glob / age / non-code files          | `fd PATTERN path/`                     |
| Repo isn't indexed yet                        | `crabcc index` (or `rg`/`fd` for now)  |
| Single small file, raw lines                  | `rg -n pattern file` is already cheap  |

**Never reach for `grep -rn` or `find . -name`** on a real repo.

## Status

Pre-v1. Languages: TS/TSX/JS/Ruby. Tests: 60 (53 core + 7 MCP). License: MIT.

Roadmap (open):
- Edges table populated from extractor → call graph queries from SQL only
- `crabcc grep` with enclosing-symbol annotation (currently a TODO stub)
- More languages (Go, Python, Rust)
- crabcc loses on small single-file ops: should add `outline --compact` for tighter JSON
